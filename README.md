## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
- This assignment helped me with my git skills.
- Messed up the layout when trying to refactor some CSS so I was able to checkout an older git commit, create and work on a new branch, and then merge it back into the main branch.
- Spent a longer time than expected working on the absolute positioning of the svg background images to keep them aligned with the card.
